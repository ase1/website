				I've had this idea written down on my <i>Things to Accomplish</i> list since freshman year, after discovering the trials and tribulations of having to do your own laundry. It was stupid, funny, and just weird enough that it might catch on at Rice. The idea was simple: make a lost and found app, specifically for socks, playing off the idea that everyone regularly loses socks in the laundry. However, being entirely untrained in the field of computer science, I knew I couldn't do it myself. Therefore, I set out to find a group of people who valued their time as little as I did. <br><br>
				
				Fast forward a semester. I had put the project on standby since I didn't know where to begin. Then, one email changed everything. <i>Elevator Pitch Competiton - Open to all Undergraduates</i>, the subject read. I signed up for the elevator pitch with the best pitch I could think of - the Missing Sock Coalition. I figured it would give me valuable experience, and it doesn't hurt to start early. Here's my speech: 
				
				<blockquote>Who here has ever been doing laundry, sorting out your clothes, pairing up your socks, getting really into it, when suddenly, there's a sock that's left lonely? Or maybe you find a sock that you've never seen before. We can all agree that the missing sock problem is a tiny inconvenience, but those tiny inconveniences add up. In fact, if each college student in the US loses one sock per month, lost socks create a 3 million dollar industry. My name's Andrew, and I'm proposing a systematic way to unify the users of each laundry room to reunite separated socks. I'm calling it the Missing Sock Coalition. <br>
				Alright, so here's the premise: Rice is a closed system. Any sock that gets lost is bound to get found. Imagine a mobile app. Users declare a sock either lost or found, post a picture of the sock, and fill out some details on the size, color, and style. The system matches socks and lists the results in a Craigslist-style interface. If you find your sock's twin, you contact the other party and arrange for a handoff. Users can pay to highlight socks as high-priority, say for a uniform or a sentimental sock. This will send an “Argyle alert” to the users of the laundry room. I did some preliminary coding in Google Apps Script, but it's not intuitive. I want there to be No Sock Left Behind. To make this a reality, I need a mobile developer who has both a taste for database management and also good taste in socks. We need the Missing Sock Coalition because we simply can't have our next generation of movers and shakers walking around like this. [pull up pant leg, revealing horribly mismatched socks]</blockquote>

				What I didn't know about the Elevator Pitch Competition was that it is a very fancy event. Sure, I was wearing a tie, but <b>everyone</b> was wearing a tie. It was in the Jones School of Business, with hors d'oeuvres and a lot of potential employers. And here I was, some sophomore tripping over his 90-second speech among literally every senior design project in the school. Still, it was eye-opening and I got a huge amount of feedback for both the project and my presentation. <br><br>
				
				A few months later, I banded together with a bunch of misfits for <a href='http://hack.rice.edu/'>HackRice</a>. My team consisted of Roshni Kaushik, Mohith Maratt, Haibo Chen, and Jeremy Wenzel. We were brainstorming, and though we had a bunch of great ideas, we ended up going with the Missing Sock Coalition. Except this time, we thought it would be a great idea to re-brand it into a dating app, for socks (otherwise it's a very limited lost and found app). We were going to make it a webapp, but were worried about backend processing, so we went with Android. Everyone installed Android Studio and tried to learn its many intricacies, but the learning curve is pretty steep, especially given that HackRice is a 24-hour hackathon and some of my team members didn't know Java. After one bricked computer, 4 failed backend attempts, and 8 combined hours of sleep, we had a layout for a rudimentary Android app. Unfortunately, we couldn't get our backend working in time so that put us out of the question as far as judging was concerned. <br><br>
				
				This brings us to the current day. I'm working on creating a backend in Azure, which has proven to be much easier than I expected because Azure is awesome. I get a hundred dollars worth of hosting per month through my Microsoft Student Partner MSDN subscription, so I'm taking full advantage of that. I'm not sure if the rest of my team is still interested in the project, but I want to see it finished and on the Play Store.
